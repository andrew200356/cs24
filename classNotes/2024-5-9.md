# Enums

```cpp

    person.gender = "male";
    person.gender = "other";
    person.gender = "Female";   // notice this start with captical

```

String is not great option since the are slow and too permissive

```cpp
    // but if you have code like:

    if(gender =="male"){
        //
    }else if(gender == "female"){
        // node the code would not trigger here since we only got "Female"
    }else{
        // slow and two permissive
        // also string comparison is much less effcient than tradtional way
    }
```

what if we make integer for each of them?

```cpp
    person.gender = 0;
    person.gender = 2;
```

fast; permissive; confusing (it allows you to do too much)

## ENUM can do the trick

```cpp
enum class Gender: unsigned char{
    MALE;
    // or you could do
    // MALE = 0;
    FEMALE;
    OTHER;
}
Gender(int a; int b){

}

person.gender = Gender::MALE;
              = Gender::FEMALE;

if(gender == Gender::MALE){

}
```

## default arguments

```cpp
struct Vector{
    Vector(size_t capacity = 8);
    // Vector();
}

// Now if you do:

Vector v1();    // this set capacity to 8, the default value
Vector v2(2);   // this set capacity to 2
```

However, later when you try to implememt Vector:

```cpp
Vector::Vector(size_t capacity = 8){
    // here capacity = 8 is not allowed
}
```

## std::istream &

The isteam is a abstract base type

is contains my subtype, like:

```cpp
std::cin
std::ifstream
std::istringstream
```

## Virtual Destructors

when you have a subclass with dif destructor, make sure the parent destrcutor is virtual
so the destuctor will run throught even level bottom to top

## V tables

V tables are used to implement polymorphism in C++
V tables are used to implement virtual functions in C++
